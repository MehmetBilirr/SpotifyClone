# SpotifyClone

I built this project myself to experience more MVVM Pattern, Protocols, URLSession and REST API.

The iOS App consumes the official Spotify Web API to show (and play) songs, artists, albums, and more. 

The user logs in with a Spotify account and gives permission to access the user's data, user-liked playlists, and songs that the user saved in the music library. 

This API service for developers allows songs to be played preview for 29 seconds.
